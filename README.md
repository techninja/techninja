My name is James **(He/Him)**, known online as `techninja`, and I've been programming and contributing to the open source community for longer than I can remember. With over 12 years of experience in writing ReSTful APIs, wrappers, and developer documentation, I have honed a strong skill set in API design, implementation, and documentation with a focus on making code and examples readable and user-friendly.

I've spoken at open source software conferences, traveled the world working to get kids into STEAM through an instructional video series and drawing robots, and strive to make all the code and user interfaces I have a hand in more documented, accessible, and helpful to those that come after me.
